Digital Stories is a simple MERN stack app that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes.

- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- ✨Magic ✨

## Getting Started

### Installation
To install the app, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mynotes.git
```
2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
    cd mynotes
    npm install
```

### Running the App
To run the app, use the following command:
```bash
    npm start
```
This will start the server and the client, and open the app in your default browser.

## Architecture
### Overview
The app is built using the MERN stack:
- MongoDB for the database
- Express.js for the server
- React for the client
- Node.js as the runtime environment

### Backend
The backend of the app is built using Express.js and Node.js. Here are the main components:
- `server.js`: The main server file that sets up the Express.js app and connects to the database.
- `routes/notes.js`: Defines the API endpoints for CRUD operations on notes.
- `controllers/notes.js`: Implements the logic for CRUD operations on notes.
- `models/note.js`: Defines the schema for the notes in the database.

### Frontend
The frontend of the app is built using React. Here are the main components:

- `App.js`: The main React component that sets up the app and renders other components.
- `components/NoteList.js`: Renders the list of notes.
- `components/AddNote.js`: Renders the form to add a new note.
- `components/EditNote.js`: Renders the form to edit an existing note.

## Troubleshooting 

## Liscence

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm i
node app
```

#### Building for source

For production release:

```sh
gulp build --prod
```

Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:

```sh
gulp build dist --prod
```

out when the markdown processor does its job. There is no need to format nicely because it shouldn't be seen. Thanks SO - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/store-comments-in-markdown-syntax)
